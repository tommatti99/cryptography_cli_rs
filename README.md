Its an CLI i'm working in to learn about cryptography. 

I implemented the algorithms by hand... NO LIBS

The supported algoritms until now are:

Simetric Cryptography
- [X] Cesar Cipher 
- [X] Vigen√®re Cipher
- [X] Xor Cipher
- [ ] Transposition Cipher
- [ ] Advanced Encryption Standard
- [ ] Data Encryption Standard

Asymetric Cryptography
- [ ] RSA
- [ ] Diffie-Hellman
- [ ] Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- [ ] SHA-256
- [ ] Hash-based Message Authentication Code
