Its an CLI i'm working in to learn about cryptography. 

I implemented the algorithms by hand... NO LIBS

The supported algoritms until now are:

Simetric Cryptography
- [X] Cesar Cipher 
- [X] Vigen√®re Cipher
- [X] Xor Cipher
- [ ] Transposition Cipher
- [ ] Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- [ ] Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Asymetric Cryptography
- [ ] Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
- [ ] Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
- [ ] Diffie-Hellman (DH)
- [ ] Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

Cryptography Hash 
- [ ] MD4
- [ ] MD5
- [ ] Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
- [ ] Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)
- [ ] Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2)
- [ ] Keccak (SHA-3)
